## Introduction

Hi, after a long time I finally have an update to share.

I finally decided to switch to [**Astro Framework**](https://astro.build/) 
to use for the website. I have been using [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) 
for around 8 months now and I was happy with it but I wanted to try something new and Astro 
seemed like a good choice. It's raw performance and simplicity is what I was looking for.

I used the [**Astro Cactus Template**](https://github.com/chrismwilliams/astro-theme-cactus) 
to design my website as I find it appears very clean and minimalistic.

## Goals

I wanted to achieve the following goals:

-   I wanted to achieve a good performance score on 
    [**Google Lighthouse**](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) 
    and [**Web.dev**](https://web.dev/measure/).


## Results

After running the tests multiple times I achieved the following results:

**Google Lighthouse**

| Category       | Min Score | Max Score |
| -------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Performance    | 90        | 100       |
| Accessibility  | 97        | 100       |
| Best Practices | 100       | 100       |
| SEO            | 100       | 100       |


**Web.dev**

| Category       | Min Score | Max Score |
| -------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Performance    | 100       | 100       |
| Accessibility  | 100       | 100       |
| Best Practices | 100       | 100       |
| SEO            | 100       | 100       |
